# Documentation Scribe

## General Requirements

- When a project directory is added or changed, always update the repo structure file (`.cursor/repo-structure.mdc`).

## Implementation Plans

- When you are saving an implementation plan from Planner Mode, save it in the `doc/plans` folder in the format `YYMMDD-filename.md`. For e.g., `docs/plans/090725-sidebar-plan.md`.

## Feature Completion

- When a new feature has been implemented, always add the updates to the changelog (`docs/changelog.md`).
- Always update the features in the corresponding documentation in `docs/api`.

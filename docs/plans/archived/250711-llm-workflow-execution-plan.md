# ðŸŽ¯ **LLM WORKFLOW EXECUTION IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

**Date**: July 11, 2025  
**Objective**: Make LLM invocation actually work with proper streaming to multiple output nodes

---

## **PHASE 1: Multiple Output Node Streaming**

### **1.1 Fix ExecutionEngine Output Detection**

**Problem**: Currently only streams to the first output node found  
**Solution**: Stream to ALL connected output nodes simultaneously

**Changes to `src/lib/execution-engine.ts`:**

- Modify `executeLLMNode()` to find ALL output nodes (not just first)
- Update streaming callbacks to broadcast to multiple outputs
- Ensure each output node receives identical streamed content

### **1.2 Enhance Stream Distribution**

- Update `onStart`, `onContent`, `onComplete` callbacks to iterate through all output nodes
- Maintain streaming state across multiple outputs
- Handle error propagation to all connected outputs

---

## **PHASE 2: Output Node Content Preservation**

### **2.1 Preserve Previous Content**

**Problem**: Output nodes may clear content on workflow restart  
**Solution**: Only update content when new data arrives, preserve existing content otherwise

**Changes to `src/lib/execution-engine.ts`:**

- Remove any content clearing logic from workflow start
- Only update output node content when LLM actually streams new data
- Preserve `tokenCount` and other metadata until overwritten

### **2.2 Smart Content Management**

- Distinguish between "no content yet" and "preserved from previous run"
- Update output node UI to show appropriate placeholders
- Maintain content history for time-travel functionality

---

## **PHASE 3: Enhanced Streaming Infrastructure**

### **3.1 Streaming State Management**

**Problem**: Need better coordination between global workflow state and individual node states  
**Solution**: Enhance state management for dual-level status tracking

**Changes to `src/lib/store.ts`:**

- Maintain both global workflow `isRunning` and individual node `status`
- Add streaming coordination for multiple outputs
- Ensure proper state transitions during execution

### **3.2 Real-time Stream Broadcasting**

- Implement proper stream fanout to multiple output nodes
- Ensure streaming cursor appears on all connected outputs simultaneously
- Coordinate streaming completion across all outputs

---

## **PHASE 4: Execution Flow Refinement**

### **4.1 Dependency-Based Execution Optimization**

**Current**: Dependency-based execution works correctly  
**Enhancement**: Optimize for streaming scenarios with multiple outputs

- Ensure text prompt nodes output immediately when ready
- LLM nodes begin processing as soon as input text is available
- Output nodes start displaying streams immediately when connected LLM begins

### **4.2 Error Handling and Recovery**

- Propagate errors to all connected output nodes
- Handle partial streaming failures gracefully
- Maintain workflow state consistency during errors

---

## **PHASE 5: UI/UX Polish and Integration**

### **5.1 Visual Status Indicators**

- Global workflow status in Start node (running/idle)
- Individual node status badges (idle/running/success/error)
- Streaming indicators on all active output nodes
- Coordinate visual feedback across the entire workflow

### **5.2 Performance Optimization**

- Efficient stream broadcasting to multiple outputs
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders during streaming
- Optimize state updates for real-time performance

---

## **IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **Key Changes Required:**

1. **ExecutionEngine.executeLLMNode()**:

   - Change `outputNode` to `outputNodes` (array)
   - Update all streaming callbacks to iterate through array
   - Broadcast identical content to all connected outputs

2. **Output Node Content Strategy**:

   - Never clear content on workflow start
   - Only update when new streaming data arrives
   - Preserve metadata (token counts, timestamps)

3. **State Management**:
   - Global `workflow.isRunning` for overall status
   - Individual `node.data.status` for each node
   - Coordinate streaming states across multiple outputs

### **Edge Cases to Handle:**

- LLM node connected to 0 output nodes (should still execute)
- LLM node connected to multiple different output node types
- Streaming interruption/cancellation across multiple outputs
- Error propagation to all connected nodes

---

## **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

âœ… **Multiple Output Streaming**: One LLM node streams to 2+ output nodes simultaneously  
âœ… **Content Preservation**: Previous run content remains until new content arrives  
âœ… **Visual Feedback**: Both global and individual node status indicators work  
âœ… **Execution Flow**: Nodes execute in proper dependency order with streaming  
âœ… **Error Handling**: Failures propagate correctly to all connected outputs

---

## **IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE**

- **Phase 1**: Multiple Output Streaming (~45 minutes)
- **Phase 2**: Content Preservation (~20 minutes)
- **Phase 3**: Streaming Infrastructure (~30 minutes)
- **Phase 4**: Execution Flow Refinement (~15 minutes)

### **Key Improvements Delivered:**

âœ… **Multiple Output Streaming**: One LLM node now streams identical content to all connected output nodes simultaneously  
âœ… **Content Preservation**: Output nodes preserve previous content until new streaming data arrives  
âœ… **Enhanced Error Handling**: Errors propagate to all connected outputs with cleanup and better messages  
âœ… **Coordinated Status**: Global workflow state and individual node states work together seamlessly  
âœ… **Visual Feedback**: All nodes show appropriate status indicators during execution and streaming  
âœ… **Session Status Preservation**: Sessions maintain "workflow running" (blue) status during execution instead of being marked as "unsaved" (yellow)

### **Technical Changes Made:**

1. **`src/lib/execution-engine.ts`**:

   - Modified `executeLLMNode()` to find ALL output nodes instead of just the first
   - Updated streaming callbacks to broadcast to multiple outputs via `forEach` loops
   - Enhanced error handling with state cleanup and better error messages
   - Improved output node execution logic to preserve content when connected to LLM nodes
   - Updated to use `updateNodeDataDuringExecution()` to preserve workflow running status

2. **`src/lib/store.ts`**:

   - Added `updateNodeDataDuringExecution()` function for execution-time updates that don't mark sessions as unsaved
   - Preserves "workflow running" (blue) status during execution instead of marking as "unsaved" (yellow)

3. **Streaming Flow**:
   - `onStart`: Initializes streaming state on all connected output nodes
   - `onContent`: Broadcasts identical streamed content to all outputs
   - `onComplete`: Updates all outputs with final content and token counts
   - `onError`: Cleans up streaming state and propagates errors to all outputs

the llm workflow execution system now properly supports the full streaming workflow with multiple outputs, content preservation, and coordinated visual feedback.

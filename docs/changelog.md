# Changelog

## [Unreleased] - 2025-07-11

### ‚ú® Major Features Added

#### LLM Workflow Execution System

- **Multiple Output Streaming**: LLM invocation nodes now stream identical content to ALL connected output nodes simultaneously
- **Content Preservation**: Output nodes preserve previous run content until new streaming data arrives, eliminating unwanted content clearing
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Errors propagate to all connected output nodes with proper state cleanup and descriptive error messages
- **Coordinated Status Management**: Both global workflow state and individual node states work together seamlessly
- **Real-time Visual Feedback**: All nodes show appropriate status indicators during execution and streaming phases

#### Execution Engine Improvements

- **Broadcasting Streams**: Modified `executeLLMNode()` to find ALL connected output nodes instead of just the first one
- **Parallel Output Updates**: All streaming callbacks (`onStart`, `onContent`, `onComplete`, `onError`) now use `forEach` loops to broadcast to multiple outputs
- **Smart Content Management**: Output nodes connected to LLM nodes preserve content, while those connected to text nodes update immediately
- **Error State Cleanup**: Error handling now properly cleans up streaming state and provides contextual error messages
- **Workflow Coordination**: Improved dependency-based execution flow for optimal streaming performance

#### App-Wide Dark Mode Implementation

- **Complete Theme System**: Implemented fully functional app-wide dark mode with immediate switching, persistence, and system detection
- **ThemeProvider Integration**: Added next-themes ThemeProvider wrapper for seamless theme management across all components
- **Theme Toggle Button**: Beautiful header toggle button that cycles through light ‚Üí dark ‚Üí system modes with appropriate icons (Sun, Moon, Monitor)
- **System Theme Detection**: Real-time detection and response to OS theme changes when "system" mode is selected
- **Theme Persistence**: Theme choices persist across app sessions through existing settings infrastructure
- **Bidirectional Synchronization**: Complete sync between next-themes, Zustand store, and settings service
- **Enhanced Appearance Tab**: Updated settings appearance tab to use new theme actions for immediate application
- **Smooth Transitions**: Polished animations and hover effects throughout the theme switching experience

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### Streaming and Output Issues

- **Fixed Single Output Limitation**: Resolved issue where LLM nodes only streamed to the first connected output node
- **Fixed Content Clearing**: Eliminated unwanted content clearing on workflow restart - content now persists until new data arrives
- **Fixed Error Propagation**: Errors now properly propagate to all connected output nodes with appropriate cleanup

#### LLM Node Execution Issues

- **Fixed Unconnected LLM Node Errors**: LLM nodes with no input connections now maintain their original "idle" state instead of throwing errors during workflow execution
- **Improved Execution Flow**: Modified execution engine to skip LLM nodes without inputs while properly marking them as completed for workflow continuation

#### Session Error Management

- **Automatic Error Clearing**: Session errors are now automatically cleared when starting a new workflow execution, preventing stale error messages from persisting in the session tab
- **Enhanced Stream Coordination**: Multiple output nodes now show synchronized streaming indicators and content
- **Fixed Session Status During Execution**: Resolved issue where streaming updates marked sessions as "unsaved" (yellow) instead of preserving "workflow running" (blue) status

#### Text Node Persistence

- **Fixed Text Node Data Loss**: Resolved issue where text entered in text nodes was lost when the app refreshed, reverting to the default "Write a short poem about coding" text
- **Improved State Synchronization**: Added proper synchronization between local component state and store data to ensure text persists across app reloads

### üèóÔ∏è Technical Improvements

#### Execution Flow

- **Stream Fanout**: Implemented proper stream broadcasting to multiple output nodes
- **State Consistency**: Enhanced state management to maintain consistency across global workflow and individual node states
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimized streaming updates to minimize unnecessary re-renders while maintaining real-time feedback
- **Execution State Management**: Added `updateNodeDataDuringExecution()` function to update node data during workflow execution without marking sessions as unsaved, preserving proper status indicators

#### Theme System Architecture

- **Theme Service Bridge**: Created `theme-service.ts` to bridge between next-themes and Zustand store with bidirectional synchronization
- **Theme Sync Hook**: Implemented `useThemeSync` custom hook for automatic theme synchronization and system detection
- **Store Integration**: Added `setTheme` and `initializeTheme` actions to Zustand store for centralized theme management
- **Settings Service Enhancement**: Extended settings service with theme application methods for immediate theme switching
- **Header Integration**: Seamlessly integrated theme toggle into app header with proper drag region handling

### ‚ú® Major Features Added

#### Settings Management System

- **Sidebar Footer**: Added settings footer component at bottom of left sidebar with theme indicator and provider status
- **Comprehensive Settings Dialog**: Implemented tabbed settings interface with four main sections:
  - **Providers Tab**: LLM provider configuration with secure API key management
  - **Appearance Tab**: Theme selection (light/dark/system)
  - **Preferences Tab**: Auto-save intervals and default model parameters
  - **Advanced Tab**: Settings export/import and reset functionality
- **Secure API Key Storage**: API keys stored using Tauri's secure store with encryption
- **Provider Management**: Support for OpenAI (active), Anthropic, Google, Cohere, and Ollama (future)
- **Settings Persistence**: Non-sensitive settings stored locally with export/import capability
- **Provider Status Indicators**: Visual status dots showing provider configuration state

#### Enhanced LLM Service

- **Configurable Providers**: Refactored LLM service to use settings-based API key configuration
- **Secure API Integration**: API keys loaded from secure storage for each request
- **Provider Fallback**: Graceful fallback to OpenAI for unsupported providers
- **Better Error Handling**: Clear error messages for missing API keys and provider issues

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### API Key Storage Issue

- **Fixed API Key Validation**: Resolved issue where OpenAI API keys weren't being saved due to overly restrictive validation pattern
- **Root Cause**: The OpenAI API key pattern was expecting exactly 48 characters, but modern OpenAI API keys have variable lengths
- **Solution**: Updated pattern from `/^sk-[a-zA-Z0-9]{48}$/` to `/^sk-[a-zA-Z0-9]{20,}$/` to accept at least 20 characters after the `sk-` prefix
- **Enhanced User Feedback**: Added loading states, success messages, and clear error messages for API key saving operations
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better error messages and visual feedback throughout the provider settings interface
- **Removed Restrictive Format Validation**: Eliminated API key format patterns in favor of actual connection testing
- **Real Connection Testing**: Implemented actual API connection testing for OpenAI to validate keys by making real API calls
- **User-Friendly Validation**: API keys are now validated by testing if they actually work, not by arbitrary format rules

#### Output Node NaN Display Issue

- **Fixed NaN Token Count**: Resolved issue where output nodes displayed "NaN" instead of token counts after successful streaming
- **Root Cause**: The AI SDK sometimes returns `undefined` for `usage.totalTokens`, which was being passed through and displayed as NaN
- **Solution**: Added validation in LLM service to only pass valid numbers for token counts, and enhanced OutputNode to safely handle invalid token counts
- **Defensive Programming**: OutputNode now checks for `typeof tokenCount === 'number' && !isNaN(tokenCount)` before displaying
- **Clean State**: Token count is cleared at the start of each new streaming operation to prevent stale NaN values

#### Session Loading Issue

- **Fixed Session Unsaved State**: Resolved issue where clicking on a session would immediately mark it as unsaved
- **Root Causes**:
  1. Canvas component was initializing demo nodes during render instead of using `useEffect`, causing interference with session loading
  2. Session metadata updates were always updating the `updatedAt` timestamp, even for internal status changes
  3. React Flow's internal change events (selection, positioning during load) were triggering `setNodes`/`setEdges` which always mark sessions as unsaved
- **Solutions**:
  1. Moved initialization logic to `useEffect` with proper conditions to prevent execution during session loading
  2. Modified `updateSessionMetadata` to only update timestamps for actual content changes, not status updates
  3. Added internal setters (`setNodesInternal`/`setEdgesInternal`) that don't mark sessions as unsaved, used for React Flow's internal changes vs user actions
